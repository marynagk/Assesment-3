## Problem Definition and Solution
 ### Problem
One of the challenges the world is facing nowadays is the increased value of time. At the same time there is a constant need to gain new knowledge and master new skills or even new professions.

- As Coderacademy students are mastering a new profession in a short period of time, there is a need in mutual support to make a progress more consistent and fast
- One of the key things the employers are looking at when evaluating candidates is the ability to set and articulate their goals
- Coderacademy Bootcamp provides a unique environment for networking and social interaction
- The students are willing to help each other
- In a normal interaction it is not easy to understand who needs what sort of help on the one hand, and who is willing to provide and what sort of help on the other hand

Taking into account all of the above there is an opportunity to boost the study goals achievement for the students by providing some platform where they can interact with each other with the focus on the goals achievement.

The criterion for the successful solution of this challenge will be:
- Safe environment - closed group interaction not visible to the non-members of the group
- Accessibility - students can access the solution from class or from home
- Possibility to share with the others the goals (problem/dream) where help is needed
- Possibility to share with the others info about own expertise (skills/strengths) which the student is willing to provide to help others
- Providing goals focused communication opportunities (recommendations/comments)
- Tracking the status of goals
- Acknowledgement of help provided by other users
- To make the solution more engaging the scope could be generalized to include personal goals and interests

No web tools have been found by me meeting the above criterion

 ###  Solution
The solution is a Coder Academy Squad - a social network for the Coderacademy group which allows to share students' personal and professional goals and expertise, and to give each other recommendations helping to achieve those goals.
